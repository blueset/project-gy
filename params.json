(Actually, it's just me.)\r\n\r\nThis project is inspired by my daily updates with lyrics on sites like Facebook and Twitter. I was then thinking about creating a blog program that focus on lyric posting, and this whole thing came to my mind. \r\n\r\nThrough Project Gy, people can share their thoughts and feelings through existing lyrics, and share them with all over the world (just people who can see it *=_=*) by simply type in the lyric and some related information. \r\n\r\n_\\* By lyrics, here I means lyrics as in the songs._\r\n\r\n## Current Version & Changelog\r\n\r\nCurrent Version:\r\n* **Beta 0.3 build 20140604**\r\n * Change - Upgraded to Bootstrap 3\r\n * Change - Admin panel theme to Start Bootstrap 2\r\n * Fix - Minor UI optimisation\r\n\r\n> Refer to Changelog.md for more.\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements\r\nThis project is built with help of the following projects:\r\n\r\n* [CodeIgniter](https://github.com/EllisLab/CodeIgniter/)\r\n* [Twitter Bootstrap](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap)\r\n* [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery)\r\n* [jQuery Masonry](http://masonry.desandro.com/)\r\n* [Yanone](http://www.yanone.de/typedesign/kaffeesatz/) for font \"Yanone Kaffeesatz\"\r\n* [Screen MFG Co.](http://www.screen.co.jp/press/pdf/NR090824C.pdf) and [iPlaysoft](http://www.iplaysoft.com/hiragino-sans.html) for \"Hiragino Sans W6\"\r\n* [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)\r\n* [Start Bootstrap Admin 2](http://startbootstrap.com/sb-admin-v2) Dashboard Theme\r\n* [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) Commenting system\r\n* [three.js](http://threejs.org/), JavaScript 3D library\r\n* [three.js Particle Engine](http://stemkoski.github.io/Three.js/Particle-Engine.html) by [Lee Stemkoski](http://www.adelphi.edu/~stemkoski/)\r\n* [Textillate.js](https://github.com/jschr/textillate), A simple plugin for CSS3 text animations\r\n* [Lettering.js](https://github.com/davatron5000/Lettering.js), a jQuery plugin for radical Web\r\n* [Animate.css](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css), Just-add-water CSS animation\r\n\r\n## First time using this?\r\n\r\nPlease refer to Wiki for [installation guide](https://github.com/1a23/project-gy/wiki/Installation).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
